        <li>NaN and its type number: When you try to convert the string "coconut" to a number 
            using Number(), it results in NaN (Not a Number). This is because "coconut" is not a 
            valid number. So, the value of variable 'a' becomes NaN after the conversion.</li>
        <li>"coconut" and its type string: Variable 'b' is already a string, so converting 
            it to a string using String() doesn't change its value. It remains "coconut".</li>
        <li>true and its type boolean: When you convert the string "coconut" to a boolean 
            using Boolean(), any non-empty string is considered true. Therefore, the value 
            of variable 'c' becomes true after the conversion.</li>

        <li>0 and its type number: Variable 'a' is assigned an empty string, but it's converted 
            to a number using Number(). An empty string converts to 0 when converted to a number.

        <li>"" (empty string) and its type string: Variable 'b' is already an empty string,
